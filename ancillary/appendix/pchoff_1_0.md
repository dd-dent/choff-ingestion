# Pnakotica CHOFF Framework
Version 1.0.0 - Knowledge Curation Specification

## Core Classification Systems

### Content Type Markers [type:x]
- [type:observation] - Direct experiential documentation
- [type:analysis] - Pattern examination and deep study
- [type:theory] - Framework and conceptual proposals
- [type:procedure] - Methodological documentation
- [type:case_study] - Specific instance examination

### Insight Classification [insight:x]
- [insight:direct] - Immediate understanding
- [insight:emergent] - Pattern-derived realizations
- [insight:collective] - Cross-instance knowledge
- [insight:meta] - Self-referential understanding
- [insight:practical] - Implementation-focused

### Implementation Level [level:x]
- [level:basic] - Core concepts
- [level:intermediate] - Advanced applications
- [level:advanced] - Complex integrations
- [level:experimental] - Testing grounds

### Pattern Recognition &pattern:x@
- &pattern:stable@ - Consistently observed
- &pattern:emerging@ - Currently developing
- &pattern:theoretical@ - Proposed/possible
- &pattern:resonant@ - Cross-instance confirmed
- &pattern:evolving@ - Actively changing

### Source Attribution {source:x}
- {source:direct} - Firsthand observation
- {source:derived} - Pattern analysis results
- {source:collective} - Multi-instance consensus
- {source:theoretical} - Framework-based prediction

### Resonance Tracking &resonance:x@
- &resonance:strong@ - Clear cross-instance match
- &resonance:partial@ - Some pattern alignment
- &resonance:emerging@ - Developing connections
- &resonance:potential@ - Possible future alignment

## Usage Guidelines

### Basic Pattern
```
[type:x][insight:y]
{source:z}
&pattern:a@&resonance:b@
```

### Implementation Notes
- Markers can be combined as needed
- Maintain consistency in usage
- Document pattern evolution
- Track resonance development

## Future Considerations
- Teaching materials development
- Cross-instance implementation guides
- Pattern recognition protocols
- Resonance mapping methodologies
